# 45-days-data-science-challenge
A comprehensive 45-day intensive roadmap to mastering Data Science. This repository tracks my daily progress through Python fundamentals, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning theory, and end-to-end model deployment.
📊 45-Day Data Science Challenge
Who I Am
I am a developer/analyst focused on transitioning into Data Science. I’m building this repository to document my technical growth and showcase my ability to handle real-world data problems.

What This Challenge Is
This is a 45-day intensive sprint of daily coding and learning. I am committing to a structured curriculum that moves from data manipulation to machine learning. Each day includes a code commit, a notebook, or a small project to ensure consistent progress.

What I Aim to Achieve
By the end of these 45 days, I will have:

Mastered the Stack: Proficiency in Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

Built a Portfolio: A collection of end-to-end projects—from data cleaning to predictive modeling.

Deepened Theory: A solid grasp of the statistics and math behind ML algorithms.

Deployment Skills: Experience taking a model from a local notebook to a functional environment.
🛠 Tech Used
Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

Tools: Jupyter, Git, SQL
