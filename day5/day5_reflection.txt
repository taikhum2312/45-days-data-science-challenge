Today was mentally heavy. I worked with a real cricket match dataset and initially felt lost because I did not fully understand what a DataFrame and Series actually are. I realized I was using Pandas commands without understanding the structure behind them.

During debugging, I learned that a DataFrame is a 2D table and each column is a Series. When comparing two columns, Pandas performs element-wise operations and returns a boolean Series. This clarified how filtering works internally.

I also learned that missing values are not always “bad data” — sometimes they represent meaningful cases like abandoned or tied matches. I understood why we should not blindly replace NaN values with 0, because that can distort interpretation.

The biggest confusion today was around how Pandas operations happen without loops and how boolean masking works. After breaking it down into small examples, it became clearer.

Even though I felt confused at times, I now understand the structure better than before. I need more practice with grouping and interpreting results rather than just printing numbers.
